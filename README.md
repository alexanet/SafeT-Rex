# SafeT-Rex
This is our autonomous car project at AXA Switzerland Hackathon in Sept 2018.
9 crazy guys (2 [AXA Sure](http://axa.ch/sure) guys, a [CarCrash](https://blog.axa.ch/kompetenz/axa-crashtests-2018-zu-drohnen-e-bikes-und-car-sharing/) prevention guy, a [3D-printer](https://www.3dhubs.com/service/171073) guy, a strategy guy, an architect, a bee keeper, a hardware tinker and a junior :-) will try to build their own autonomous RC car during the 2 days hackathon.

We have lots of experience in totally 31 Hackathons :-)

context: we are in 2030 and autonomous vehicles are reality. We as AXA would like to show today how this is working. Important for 2030's autonomous cars are the the newest prevention methods to reduce crashs. In 2030 we are not sure what animals still exist and which are new. Be prepared - Grrrrr.

## Features
- turn an existing RC car into a software controllable car using Arduino, raspberry pi3, picam
- use line or lane detection to control the car and drive along a short track 
- use object detection using any image / feature recognition algorithm (YOLO, OpenCV haar classifier, Tensorflow, etc)
- use distance control mechanism (image and ultra-sonic) to calculate the distance
- 3D-print own funny signs to control the cars speed
- build our own mobile track to train the car and to demo it at the fair / ZERO Gravity

# Demo
- show a live demo in 1st person view on the cinema stage :-) No slides.
- some other things .... pssst. surprise
